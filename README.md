# Sinatra Projects

Here is a set of mini-apps built with [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/). Some are revised command-line Ruby programs from earlier in the assignments of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

Styling is very minimal (or not at all), since that is not the focus of the project. There are three applications grouped into the overall Sinatra Projects app, this was done to deploy them as a set on Heroku. The grouped applications are:

## Caesar Cipher
A simple alphabet shift cipher attributed to Julius Caesar, ([Caesar Cipher basic info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)). A CLI Ruby programming assignment from the Ruby course of The Odin Project.

## Number Guess
This is a version of the [WebGuesser tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/web_guesser.html) from Jumpstart Labs, completed as part of the overall Sinatra module of The Odin Project.

## Word Guess
An adaptation of a CLI Ruby programming assignment to create a version of "Hangman", from the Ruby course of The Odin Project.
